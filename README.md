# Genome-wide bioinformatic analyses predict key host and viral factors in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis

The novel betacoronavirus named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a worldwide pandemic (COVID-19) after initially emerging in Wuhan, China. To better understand how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with human cells, we devised a novel, comprehensive bioinformatic strategy to analyze public RNA sequencing and viral genome sequencing data, which included:
1. Detection of differentially expressed human genes along with functional and signaling pathway enrichment analyses.
2. Analysis of changes in transcript isoform expression and usage
3. Identification of transposable elements (TEs) deregulated during infection.
4. Prediction of conserved interactions between viral RNA and human RNA-binding proteins (RBPs).
5. Prediction of viral sequence variants potentially affecting host response.

To our knowledge, this is the *first meta-analysis to predict host factors that play a specific role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, distinct from other respiratory viruses*. 

This GitHub repository contains the code to reproduce the analyses included in our manuscript submission.
