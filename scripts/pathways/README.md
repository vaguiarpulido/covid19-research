# Pathway analysis
## Software
This script uses the algorithm described in: https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/25/1/75/302846.
R version 3.3.2

Before using, the pathways from each of the public sources must be built using the below commands:
prepareSPIA(humanReactome, "Reactome", print.names=TRUE)
prepareSPIA(humanKEGG, "KEGG", print.names=TRUE)
prepareSPIA(humanBioCarta, "BioCarta", print.names=TRUE)
prepareSPIA(humanNCI, "NCI", print.names=TRUE)
prepareSPIA(humanPanther, "Panther", print.names=TRUE)

The working directory must be set to the same location where these files are stored when the pathway analysis starts.

## Input
The list of differentially-expressed genes generated by edgeR or DESeq2 (including the mapped Entrez Gene IDs)

## Output
A list of statistically significant pathways (Bonferroni-corrected p-values < 0.05). For each comparison.
